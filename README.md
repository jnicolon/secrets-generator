# Post Post Secret 

A full stack app inspired by the Post Secret website. 

Upload a secret, create a user to see all your uploaded secrets, delete a secret and display all the secrets with a random img background. 

For the API design with basic CRUD functionality, I used the Node.js Express framework and hosted it on Heroku.

I used Atlas MongoDB and mongoose for the database design.

For the front end I used REACT with Redux for state management with Thunk as middleware to make Axios calls to the back end.
