# Post Post Secret 

A full stack app inspired by the Post Secret website. 

For the API design with basic CRUD functionality I used the Node.js Express framework and hosted it on Heroku.

For the front end I used REACT with Redux for state management with Thunk as middleware to make Axios calls to the back end.
